# lab2 assignment

5 -> a  # Object with right to left assignment operator

b<- 7 # object with left to right assignment operator

x <- "bag" # object x created as character
typeof(x)

y<-1:10 # object y is set aa integer
typeof(y)

z<-10      #object z set as numeric
z
class(z)


a<-c(1,2,3,4,3,2) # object a is set as factor data
sf<-factor (a)
sf

32%%3 # the operator %% is modulus. R will call the remainder of the division 
of the first object by the second object.

20^2  # the operator ^ is an exponent. The first object is multiplying itself 
by the the numeric in the second objects. 

50%/%3  # the operator %/% is an integer division. R will call the number of 
times the second object divides the first object.  

q<-11:20 # object q is a sequence of 10 numbers.
q
a=7; b=9; c=10  # three objects with number assigned to each existing on a single 
line
a;b;c   # code for printing the values of the 3 objects.

a*b+c  # in the operation, the object a multiples with b then c is added afterwards.

a*(b+c) # the addition of b to c before multiplication of the sum with a.

# In "Inf", number is too large for computation. so R will return Inf for positive 
numbers and -Inf for a negative number.
# Inf is positive infinity while -Inf is negative infinity.

3^2034 # special value for Inf
-3^2034 # special value for -Inf.

# NaN is seen when computation produce values that make little sense.
#NaN means "not a number"

Inf-Inf # NaN
0/0 #NaN

# NA meaning "not available" is used to represent missing values in text loaded 
into R or from data base

s<-c(1,2,3,4)
length(s)
length(s)<- 6
s
# when call for the length of "s" was increased from 4 to 6, R returned two NA i.e not available on the list 

t<-7
t<-NULL
t
# NULL is returned when value is undefined.

# binary operator with 2 variables assigned with appropriate symbols between two %

'%query%'<-function(x,y){3*x + 6*y}
